## Indroduction:-

In the ever-evolving landscape of online retail, understanding customers and catering to their diverse needs and preferences has become essential for success. One powerful tool that enables businesses to effectively connect with their customers is customer segmentation. Customer segmentation involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups based on various characteristics such as demographics, purchasing behavior, preferences, and needs. By identifying these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to better meet the specific demands of each group.

The purpose of this project is to conduct customer segmentation for an online retail business. By analyzing a wealth of customer data and leveraging advanced analytical techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful insights and create actionable segments that will drive targeted marketing efforts and improve overall customer satisfaction.

The project will involve the following key steps:

Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data from various sources, including customer profiles, transaction history, browsing patterns, social media interactions, and other relevant information. This data will serve as the foundation for segmenting customers effectively.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the collected data to ensure its quality and usability. This step involves removing duplicate records, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform an in-depth exploration of the data to gain insights into customer behavior, patterns, and trends. This analysis will help identify key variables and potential segments.

Segmentation Model Development: Utilize advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to develop a segmentation model. The model will cluster customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their attributes and behavior. Popular approaches such as clustering algorithms, decision trees, or neural networks may be employed, depending on the complexity of the data and desired outcomes.

Segment Validation and Profiling: Evaluate the segmentation model's effectiveness by assessing the homogeneity within segments and heterogeneity between segments. Validate the segments using external criteria, such as domain expertise or business goals. Finally, profile each segment by summarizing its unique characteristics, preferences, and behaviors.

Strategy Formulation: Translate the insights gained from the segmentation analysis into actionable strategies. Develop tailored marketing campaigns, personalized recommendations, and customized customer experiences that align with the needs and preferences of each segment.

Monitoring and Iteration: Continuously monitor and refine the segmentation model based on new data and changing market dynamics. Regularly assess the effectiveness of the implemented strategies and make necessary adjustments to ensure ongoing customer satisfaction and business growth.

By successfully executing this customer segmentation project, the online retail business will be empowered with a deep understanding of its customer base, enabling it to make data-driven decisions and deploy targeted marketing efforts. The insights gained from this project will facilitate improved customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty, ultimately driving business success in the competitive online retail landscape.

## Problem Description :
In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.


## Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:
The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?

Frequency – How often do they purchase?

Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.


## Conclusions:


In conclusion, this online retail segmentation project focused on developing customer segments for a UK-based online store specializing in unique all occasion gifts. By employing a combination of recency, frequency, and monetary analysis (RFM), we successfully segmented customers into clusters, achieving a high average silhouette score of 0.39 for two clusters.

Through the utilization of various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, we explored different perspectives and obtained valuable insights. By considering the Elbow Curve and Silhouette Score criteria, we determined that the optimal number of clusters for our dataset is four.

The project highlighted the importance of starting with a simple binning and quantile-based segmentation model, as it provided a preliminary understanding of the data and guided subsequent analysis. The more complex models allowed for a deeper exploration and exploitation of the data, revealing meaningful clusters based on behavioral attributes such as valuability, loyalty, and profitability.

The segmentation results and major segments derived from this project are dependent on the specific goals of the business and the desired level of granularity. By considering different criteria and our understanding of the business, we clustered the major segments accordingly.

Overall, this project has provided valuable insights into customer segmentation, empowering the online retail store to better understand and cater to the unique needs and preferences of its customers, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving business growth.
