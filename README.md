## Indroduction:-

Businesses all over the world are growing every day. With the help of technology, they have access to a wider market and hence, a large customer base. Customer segmentation refers to categorizing customers into different groups with similar characteristics.

This project aims to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set for a UK-based online retail.

## Problem Description :
In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. rfm_model

## The need of customer segmentation:
The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:

Target Marketing

Client understanding

Optimal product placement

Revenue growth

## Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:
The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?

Frequency – How often do they purchase?

Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.

## Approach taken
Data inspection

EDA 

Data preparation

Create RFM model

Implementing various clustering Models and validating


## Conclusions:


In conclusion, this online retail segmentation project focused on developing customer segments for a UK-based online store specializing in unique all occasion gifts. By employing a combination of recency, frequency, and monetary analysis (RFM), we successfully segmented customers into clusters, achieving a high average silhouette score of 0.39 for two clusters.

Through the utilization of various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, we explored different perspectives and obtained valuable insights. By considering the Elbow Curve and Silhouette Score criteria, we determined that the optimal number of clusters for our dataset is four.

The project highlighted the importance of starting with a simple binning and quantile-based segmentation model, as it provided a preliminary understanding of the data and guided subsequent analysis. The more complex models allowed for a deeper exploration and exploitation of the data, revealing meaningful clusters based on behavioral attributes such as valuability, loyalty, and profitability.

The segmentation results and major segments derived from this project are dependent on the specific goals of the business and the desired level of granularity. By considering different criteria and our understanding of the business, we clustered the major segments accordingly.

Overall, this project has provided valuable insights into customer segmentation, empowering the online retail store to better understand and cater to the unique needs and preferences of its customers, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving business growth.
